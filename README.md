# Fantasy Football meets Statistics

The project combines the fun of playing Fantasy Football with a systematic approach to football data. 

The goal is to support each Fantasy Football coach, by enhancing its decision making via an automated pipeline that predictions
on players and suggestions on lineups.

The repository contains a set of functions to process data related to soccer teams and players. I rely on free external APIs as well as scraping mechanism.
The project also includes a pipeline to train, test, and deploy a performance prediction model on Fantasy Football players.

More to come, stay tuned...
